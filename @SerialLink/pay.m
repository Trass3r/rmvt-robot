%SerialLink.PAY Joint forces due to payload
%
% TAU = R.PAY(W, J) returns the generalised joint force/torques due to a
% payload wrench W (1x6) and where the manipulator Jacobian is J (6xN). 
%
% TAU = R.PAY(Q, W, F) as above but the Jacobian is calculated at pose Q
% (1xN) in the frame given by F which is '0' for world frame, 'n' for
% end-effector frame.
%
% Uses the formula TAU = J'W, where W is a wrench vector applied at the end
% effector, W = [Fx Fy Fz Mxx Myy Mzz]'.
%
% Trajectory operation::
%
% In the case Q is MxN then TAU is MxN where each row is the generalised
% force/torque at the pose given by corresponding row of Q.
%
% Notes::
% - Tool transforms are not taken into consideration.
