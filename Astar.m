%Astar A* navigation class
% 
% A concrete subclass of the Navigation class that implements the A* navigation algorithm. This 
% provides minimum distance paths that are guaranteed optimal.
% 
% Methods::
%     plan              Compute the cost map given a goal and map
%     path              Compute a path to the goal
%     visualize         Display the obstacle map (deprecated)
%     plot              Display the obstacle map
%     costmap_modify    Modify the costmap
%     costmap_get       Return the current costmap
%     costmap_set       Set the current costmap
%     distancemap_get   Get the current distance map
%     heuristic_get     Get the current heuristic map
%     display           Print the parameters in human readable form
%     char              Convert to string
% 
% Properties::
% costmap             Distance from each point to the goal.
% 
% Example::
%         load map1           % load map
%         goal = [50;30];
%         start = [20;10];
%         as = Astar(map);    % create Navigation object
%         as.plan(goal);      % setup costmap for specified goal
%         as.path(start);     % plan solution path star-goal, animate
%         P = as.path(start); % plan solution path star-goal, return path
%
% Example 2:
%         goal = [100;100];
%         start = [1;1];
%         as = Astar(0);      % create Navigation object with random occupancy grid
%         as.plan(goal);      % setup costmap for specified goal
%         as.path(start);     % plan solution path start-goal, animate
%         P = as.path(start); % plan solution path start-goal, return path
%     
% Notes::
% - Obstacles are represented by Inf in the costmap.
% - The value of each element in the costmap is the shortest distance from the corresponding 
%   point in the map to the current goal.
